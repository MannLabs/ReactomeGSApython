# ReactomeGSApython
Python interface to Reactome's gene set enrichment analysis service.

The notebook includes a class that provides similar (but limited) functionality as the ReactomeGSA R package (https://doi.org/doi:10.18129/B9.bioc.ReactomeGSA), but in python, to construct and send requests to Reactome's GSA service (http://gsa.reactome.org/0.1/ui/).

A minimal example is included.
